# Python Exercice - Construct the CONWAY Sequence

## Exercise 1: printLevel.py
This exercise is a classic one in development courses. The objective is to develop the algorithm constructing the CONWAY sequence as illustrated.

The CONWAY sequence is something starting like that :

```
1
11
21
1211
111221
312211
13112221
1113213211
...
```

## Exercise 1: printLevelExtra.py
This exercise is a litte one. It is just to add the row number of each stage in your CONWAY sequence generated in the 1st exercise.

The CONWAY sequence will be displayed like :

```
1: 1
2: 11
3: 21
4: 1211
5: 111221
6: 312211
7: 13112221
8: 1113213211
...
```
